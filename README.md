## 📝 Introduction
This project aims to classify disaster-related tweets using Natural Language Processing techniques. It is a part of the Kaggle competition "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets."

## 🔍 Problem and Data Description
Briefly describe the challenge problem and NLP. Describe the size, dimension, structure, etc., of the data.

The challenge is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. The dataset consists of 10,000 tweets that have been manually classified. Each sample in the dataset includes the text of the tweet, a keyword from the tweet (if available), and the location the tweet was sent from (if available).
