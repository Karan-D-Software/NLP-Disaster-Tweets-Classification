    "This project aims to classify disaster-related tweets using Natural Language Processing techniques. It is a part of the Kaggle competition \"Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Problem and Data Description\n",
    "Briefly describe the challenge problem and NLP. Describe the size, dimension, structure, etc., of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. The dataset consists of 10,000 tweets that have been manually classified. Each sample in the dataset includes the text of the tweet, a keyword from the tweet (if available), and the location the tweet was sent from (if available).
